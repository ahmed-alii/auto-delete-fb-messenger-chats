This project is a script that automates the process of deleting chats on Facebook Messenger. It simplifies the task of clearing your chat history by automating the process.


### Prerequisites
- Make sure you are logged in to your Facebook account in a web browser.
- Make sure you are in Facebook Messenger.
- Make sure you are ready!

### Usage
1. Scroll to the bottom of your chats list in Facebook Messenger to load all chats.

2. Open the browser's developer console:
   - **Chrome**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + J` (or `Cmd + Option + J` on Mac).
   - **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + K` (or `Cmd + Option + K` on Mac).
   - **Edge**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac).
   - **Safari**: Go to `Safari Preferences -> Advanced`, and check "Show Develop menu in menu bar." Then, open the "Develop" menu and select "Show JavaScript Console."

3. Copy and paste the contents of `script.js` into the console.

4. Hit `Enter` to run the script. It will start deleting your chats one by one.

**Note**: Do not minimize the browser while the script is running, as it may interrupt the process.
